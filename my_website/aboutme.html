    <img src="images/dogpoop.jpg" height="550">
  </body>My name is Angel, Im 16 years old and live in a small city in Washington. I attend Tumwater Highschool as a junior, I don't do sports and I rather read then do school activities. An intresting fact about me is that I'm bisexual, this is one thing that sets myself apart from most of my highschool population, I'm telling you this because until last year I was not comftorable telling people. I, like most teenagers spend most of my freetime watching Netflix and going on the various social medias that there are, but I also spend my time writing. Those are the basic things about me, hope you feel a little closer to knowing who I am.
